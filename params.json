I suppose you're expecting an introduction or something, well I'll try.\r\n\r\nMy name's Jaimyn Mayer and I love hacking, making and breaking things.  If it has anything to do with UAVs (drones), 3D printing, electronics or programming, I will generally have a passion for it!  I especially like arduinos and things that fly.  Below is a list of some things I've done in the past and some of my current project(s).\r\n\r\n### [Car Companion](http://jabelone.github.io/CarCompanion/)\r\nThis is my favourite and biggest project at the moment.  I have an old '96 Nissan Pulsar sedan that is just asking to be hacked.  Basically there is an arduino sitting in it controlling all sorts of things.  It also interfaces with an Android smartphone via Bluetooth to do cool things like automatic proximity unlocking.\r\n\r\n### [Arduino Vixen Controller](https://github.com/jabelone/arduino-vixen-controller)\r\nThis was a small piece of Arduino software I wrote that took a serial input from a program running on a computer called Vixen.  It is used to create musical light shows, like the ones that appear on Facebook around Christmas time.  Being a poor student, I didn't have enough money to buy a \"proper\" controller so I decided to make one.  It's pretty basic but was dirt cheap and worked really well, not to mention literally tenths of the price of a controller with similar output channels.\r\n\r\n### [Detect and Drop](https://github.com/jabelone/detect-and-drop)\r\nThis was my first \"big\" project.  It involved using a CMUcam 5 (Pixy) to do basic computer vision.  It would detect a person by recognising them as a coloured blob.  It would then actuate two servos in a patter so that three individual packages could be dropped at different times.  It had a nice LCD screen output and a PWM input to arm the system.",
